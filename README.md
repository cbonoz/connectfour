ROI Calculator Details:

The preliminary roi calculation is based on the number of positions filled by each recruiter. An increase in the number of positions filled without an increase in recruiter cost translates into a cost savings. Benefits may also be realized through better candidate screening, improved sourcing or reduced search expenses. Savings may also be realized through a reduction in the use of contract recruiters.

The more detailed calculation is based on the increase in positions filled per recruiter from Scenario 1. The improvement is reflected in a shorter time for the recruiter to find and qualify candidates for each position. There may be additional savings in time-to-hire from reduced sourcing time due to the improved job targeting, reduced interview time due to a better short list of candidates, etc.

Though we would like to just add up the total savings, it is judicious to adjust the calculation. Some savings may or may not be realized as direct cost reductions. Benefits may be realized as improved quality, process improvement or even better retention rates from hiring better candidates.
